Save the Google Analytics file (analytics.js) locally to be able to cache it for longer than 2 hours for a better PageSpeed score!

== Description ==

Often when trying to optimize the Google Pagespeed score, there is one script which still causing the 'Leverage browser caching' rule popping up: Google's own analytics.js file...

With this plugin you will be able to cache this file on your local server and enable browser caching for longer than 2 hours. The plugin will check every day if there is a newer version of the file to keep the cache up to date.

== Installation ==

Installation is very easy;

1. Upload the plugin directory `cache-external-scripts` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install it directly from the Wordpress plugin directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Once the external script is cached by the plugin, it will automatically replace the url in your current Google Analytics code (meaning you can use your current Google Analytics plugin).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I cache a custom script, or remove a default =
You can customise the list of scripts which are cached using a filter.

Add the script as an array, it must have these items:
* `external_url` This is the file we will cache

These are optional, but it'll need at least one to do anything:
* `ob_preg_replace` containing a regex pattern and replacement string for preg_replace to be run on the outputted HTML for the page
* `ob_str_replace` containing a string and replacement for ob_str_replace to be run on the outputted HTML for the page

	add_filter( 'cache_external_scripts_list', function( $scripts ) {
		// Skip caching a script by unsetting it's slug
		unset($scripts['google-legacy-analytics']);

		$scripts['my-custom-script'] = array( // Include an index to make it easy to unset elsewhere if required
			'external_url' => 'http://www.example.com/custom-script.js',
			'ob_preg_replace' => array(
				'pattern' => '#(http:|https:|)//www.example.com/custom-script.js#',
				'replacement' => '{local_url}',
			),
		);
	});

= I have installed the plugin, but I can't find the Google Analytics code in the page source code =

This plugin only caches the script and replaces it in your **current** Analytics code, containing 'analytics.js' script.
We chose not to insert the Analytics code itself because there are tons of plugins for that already, and some users require modifications in the code.

= How can I check if the Analytics code is properly cached =

We store the cached file in the wordpress `uploads` directory, in the folder called `cached-scripts`. If this folder doesn't exist or is empty, please visit the settings page of the plugin to manually fetch the script.

You can also visit the settings page to see how old the cached file is.
